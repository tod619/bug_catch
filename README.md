At first the start screen is displayed, when the user clicks the start button the choose insect screen is displayed. The user selects an inscet and that insect is displayed on the game screen. When the user clicks on the insect the insect is caught, the score increases and 2 more inscts appear, after 1 second for the first and 1.5 seconds for the second.
